# Hestia - Deep Image Recognition Framework
Hestia is a library built on top of TensorFlow 2 designed to provide simple, abstractions for image recognition and computer vision, an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. 

Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.

HESTIA is one of the first and oldest Greek goddesses and was the goddess of the hearth and the sibling of Zeus.
